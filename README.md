# procsys-testsuite
> Processing Systems Test Suite

This repository contains three elements of radiation testing of complex processing systems:
1. Test stimuli: Reliability benchmarks based on Embench
2. Test hardware: Standard and robust instrumentation for testing processing systems (SoCs) 
3. Test reporting: Standard metric for reporting the reliability of processing systems

These elements are described in detail in two main publications as well as my PhD thesis:
1. A. M. P. Mattos, D. A. Santos, and L. Dilillo, “Reliability Analysis of Baremetal and FreeRTOS Applications on Microchip PolarFire SoC RISC-V Multiprocessors Using High-Energy Protons,” in IEEE Access, 2025.
2. A. M. P. Mattos, M. R. Alas, D. A. Santos, and L. Dilillo, “Standard instrumentation for single-event effect qualification of systems-on-chip: a robust, low-cost, and open-source proposal,” in Journal of Instrumentation, 2025.
